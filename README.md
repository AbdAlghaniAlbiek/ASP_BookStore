This is my first Asp.net core APIs that I worked on, it includes many usefull libraries that every ASP.net core developer used it like:
1. `EntityFrameworkCore` with sql server db
2. `Identity` with EntityFramework that give your the power managment registeration, sign in and permissions (using policies and roles) for all users 
3. `Automapper` to exchange the form of data when comes in and out from action methods
4. Add `Microsoft.AspNetCore.JsonPatch` lib that helps in dealing with http requests with method `Path`
5. Using `JWT` for authentication and authorication of users
